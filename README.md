# React Learning Journey 🌱

This repository represents the **starting phase of my React learning**.

I began learning React recently and focused on understanding the **core concepts and basics**, rather than building a full application.



## 📘 Concepts Learned

* How the React library works
* React elements and JSX
* Functional components
* React fragments
* `useState` hook
* Component composability


## 🌱 Learning Update

Today, I built my first React-based UI while learning React.

The UI looks like a travel card layout, where:
✔️ Each card shows a place image
✔️ Country name and place name are displayed
✔️ Dates and a short description are mentioned
✔️ “View on Google Maps” link opens the location in a new tab



* Today I learned about props how it works inside the jsx .....
* Today I learned about Props in React and how they help in passing data from parent components to child components. Props make components reusable, dynamic, and easy to manage by allowing the same component to display different information without rewriting code.
* I learned more about props like props destruction and also build small jokes webpage in which i implement the concept of props.
* In order to practice the props , today i again build the same project named travel-journey(react-project2) by using props . Now I have pretty good knowledge about props ..
* I have learned the map.array() ,map() in React is used to loop through an array and return a new array of JSX elements to render dynamic lists in the UI. And I rebuild the project of joke(reactapp3) by using map() that makes the project dynamic.
* I completed a data-driven React part where I learned the importance of reusability, how to use props and map(), and improve a previously built project by converting repeated UI into simple reusable components.
* Today I start with react states in which I am going to learn lots of things like event listener, api call that i have done in JS . I start this learning pattern with the project named chef claude in which after getting the list of ingredient from the user we show some recipe to them . These recipe recommendation is fetch from claude api .
* Today i have learned about event listener..
* Today I learned how to use useState, understood the difference between props and useState, and built a small counter project to increase and decrease values using state.
* Today I just learn about callback function and difference between "Pass the new version of state and pass the callback function ". And then working on college minor project..
* Today i just learn how useState work with objects , array . change the ingredient addition form (project:cloudeChef).
## 🎯 Purpose

* To build a strong foundation in React
* To learn by experimenting with small examples
* To grow step by step into advanced React concepts
