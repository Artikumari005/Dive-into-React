# React Learning Journey 🌱

This repository represents the **starting phase of my React learning**.

I began learning React recently and focused on understanding the **core concepts and basics**, rather than building a full application.



## 📘 Concepts Learned

* How the React library works
* React elements and JSX
* Functional components
* React fragments
* `useState` hook
* Component composability


##🌱 Learning Update

Today, I built my first React-based UI while learning React.

The UI looks like a travel card layout, where:
✔️ Each card shows a place image
✔️ Country name and place name are displayed
✔️ Dates and a short description are mentioned
✔️ “View on Google Maps” link opens the location in a new tab

This helped me understand:
✔️ How JSX is written
✔️ How components are structured
✔️ How layouts are created using React and CSS
✔️ How external links work inside React components

## 🎯 Purpose

* To build a strong foundation in React
* To learn by experimenting with small examples
* To grow step by step into advanced React concepts
