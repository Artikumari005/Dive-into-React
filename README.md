# React Learning Journey 🌱

This repository represents the **starting phase of my React learning**.

I began learning React recently and focused on understanding the **core concepts and basics**, rather than building a full application.



## 📘 Concepts Learned

* How the React library works
* React elements and JSX
* Functional components
* React fragments
* `useState` hook
* Component composability


## 🌱 Learning Update

Today, I built my first React-based UI while learning React.

The UI looks like a travel card layout, where:
✔️ Each card shows a place image
✔️ Country name and place name are displayed
✔️ Dates and a short description are mentioned
✔️ “View on Google Maps” link opens the location in a new tab

This helped me understand:
✔️ How JSX is written
✔️ How components are structured
✔️ How layouts are created using React and CSS
✔️ How external links work inside React components

* Today I learned about props how it works inside the jsx .....
* Today I learned about Props in React and how they help in passing data from parent components to child components. Props make components reusable, dynamic, and easy to manage by allowing the same component to display different information without rewriting code.
* I learned more about props like props destruction and also build small jokes webpage in which i implement the concept of props.
* In order to practice the props , today i again build the same project named travel-journey(react-project2) by using props . Now I have pretty good knowledge about props ..

  
## 🎯 Purpose

* To build a strong foundation in React
* To learn by experimenting with small examples
* To grow step by step into advanced React concepts
